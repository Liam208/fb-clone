            <p>
                Being productive as a developer doesn’t mean working more hours—it means working smarter. Focus on
                consistency, avoid distractions, and take regular breaks to keep your mind fresh.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">1. Set Daily Goals</h5>
            <p>
                Start your day with a clear goal in mind. Use tools like a to-do list or Kanban board to track progress
                and break large tasks into manageable steps.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">2. Minimize Context Switching</h5>
            <p>
                Jumping between tasks or tools drains mental energy. Group similar tasks together and block off
                uninterrupted work time.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4">3. Learn to Say No</h5>
            <p>
                Protect your schedule. Politely decline tasks that don't align with your priorities or can be done
                later.
            </p>
